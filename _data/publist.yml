- title: "Shifting Dynamics of Intestinal Macrophages during Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Infection in Adult Rhesus Macaques"
  image: Nao_paper1.JPG
  description: Our results show 1)Lamina propria macrophages are short-lived and destroyed after SIV infection. 2)Intestinal submucosa macrophages are long-lived and may become SIV/HIV reservoirs. 3)Gut biopsies are insufficient for monitoring submucosal long-lived macrophages.

  description: In this review, we discuss recent data exploring the contribution of monocytes and macrophages to HIV/SIV infection and progression. Furthermore, we highlight the need to further investigate their role in pediatric cases of infection.

- title: "High Turnover of Tissue Macrophages Contributes to Tuberculosis Reactivation in Simian Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Rhesus Macaques."
  image: Mtb1.jpeg
  description: We found that increased monocyte and macrophage turnover and levels of SIV-infected lung macrophages correlated with TB reactivation. All Mtb/SIV-coinfected monkeys exhibited declines in CD4+ T cells regardless of reactivation or latency outcomes, negating lower CD4+ T-cell levels as a primary cause of Mtb reactivation.

- title: "Preferential Destruction of Interstitial Macrophages over Alveolar Macrophages as a Cause of Pulmonary Disease in Simian Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Rhesus Macaques."
  image: Lung_SIV.jpg
  description: We examined the effects of SIV infection on AMs in BAL fluid and IMs in lung tissue of rhesus macaques. SIV infection produced massive cell death of IMs that contributed to lung tissue damage. Conversely, SIV infection induced minimal cell death of AMs, and these cells maintained the lower turnover rate throughout the duration of infection. This indicates that SIV produces lung tissue damage through destruction of IMs, whereas the longer-lived AMs may serve as a virus reservoir to facilitate HIV persistence.
